# Install Minishift using Ansible
This is a pretty crude little playbook to install minishift on Fedora localhost. This could be easily modified to run on CentOS/RHEL, but I have no plans currently to do so. This is also statically set to install minishift v 1.31.0. 

## Usage
```ansible-playbook minishift-install.yaml ```
